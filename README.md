## About
Analyzing land use and land cover in specific locations like Knox County, Tennessee, is important to make important decisions for policy, understanding the growth and environmental impacts. I am using the NLCD data from 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2016, 2019, and 2021. The USGS, in partnership with several federal agencies, developed and released NLCD products in two-to-three-year intervals between 2001 and 2021. These products provide spatially explicit, multi-temporal, consistent, and reliable information on the Nation’s land use and land cover change.


## Technologies used
* Python (Geemap, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
* Canva
* Google Colab
* Microsoft Office

## Process
I used Google Colab as a main platform for creating the maps and visualizations. Python is used mainly. For spatial visualization mainly geemap is used.

## Data
- The data is available [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2021_REL_NLCD)

## Visualization
The special visualizations are depicted in the slides.

Please click on the link to open, visualize and interact with the Google Colab. You need to copy the notebook in your own google drive.
